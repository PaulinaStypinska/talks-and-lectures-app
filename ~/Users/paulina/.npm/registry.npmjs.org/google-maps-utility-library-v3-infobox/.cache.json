code's hosting of http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/tags/infobox/1.1.13/src/infobox.js as a resource no longer works. This project does not seem to have been forked anywhere yet (via this [list](http://googlemaps.github.io/libraries.html)). Therefore this lib is being published here to work with bower and npm.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"nmccready","email":"nemtcan@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-11-02T13:50:25.499Z","created":"2016-05-13T18:53:52.118Z","1.1.13":"2016-05-13T18:53:52.118Z","1.1.14":"2016-05-13T20:36:23.896Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/nmccready/google-maps-utility-library-v3-infobox","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/nmccready/google-maps-utility-library-v3-infobox.git"},"contributors":[{"name":"Nicholas McCready"}],"author":{"name":"Gary Little","url":"inspired by proof-of-concept code from Pamela Fox of Google"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/nmccready/google-maps-utility-library-v3-infobox/issues"},"license":"Apache License 2.0","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"sebdesign":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"5819ef21-176a\"","_lastModified":"Wed, 02 Nov 2016 13:50:25 GMT"}
